    <h1>Who is Esha? An Article on a Rare Species</h1>
    <p style="color:#c4074f;"><strong>An interesting article for sure.</strong> </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Esha Kamath.</strong> Who is this wonderful girl that I speak of is what you might ask. The suspision is killing you, right? Or no...Let's start off with the basics. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Her favorites, obviously. Her favorite color is magenta. A beautiful magenta. She also <strong>prefers dogs</strong> over cats, which, frankly, I disagree with. If she's talking about a dachshund, that's a different story. Enough about me (if you would like to know more, go to Esha's article about mua) back to her.

      She is also <strong>about to get her black belt</strong> in Taekwondo. WHOOOAAAA!! Her best friend <strong>Sasya loves turtles</strong>. YAYYYY SASYYYAAAA!!!!
